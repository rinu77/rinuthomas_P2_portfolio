My name is Rinu Thomas. I am currently working as **Information Security Advisor** at USAA. I have my bachelor's in **Information Systems and Cyber security**.

### Experience in Data Analysis:

I have academic experience in descriptive statistics, inferential statistics and regression analysis. I have worked with Python, R and SQL in my bachelor's and previous classes taken for this course. I am interested in learning how to create dynamic and interactive dashbaords that allow users to explore data visually.

### Interesting thing about me:

I have over 10 years of training in Karnatic music.

### An interesting website to checkout:

[**OurWorldinChart**](https://ourworldindata.org/artificial-intelligence#all-charts) provides research and data visualizations about the world's largest problems. It's a great resource for seeing how data can be used to understand and address global issues.

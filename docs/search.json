    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/rinuthomas/Documents/PracticumII/rinuthomas_P2_portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

The peak of the histogram is centered around 16 years of education. Most of the data points falls between 12 and 20 years of education. Since, the histogram appears to be fairly symmetric, there are no significant skewness or outliers in the data.\n\n#Histogram of Income\nggplot(synthetic_data, aes(x = Income)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000, fill = \"green\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Income\", x = \"Annual Income ($)\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations: The histogram shows a bell-shaped curve which suggests that the Income variable is normally distributed. The peak of the histogram is centered around 50,000 Annual Income. Most of the data points falls between 20000 and 80000 annual income. Since, the histogram appears to be fairly symmetric, there are no significant skewness or outliers in the data.\n\n# Histogram of Hours Worked Per Week\"\nggplot(synthetic_data, aes(x = HoursWorkedPerWeek)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = \"red\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Hours Worked Per Week\", x = \"Hours Worked Per Week\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations: The histogram shows a bell-shaped curve which suggests that the Hours worked per week variable is normally distributed. The peak of the histogram is centered around 40 hours per week. Most of the data points falls between 30 and 50 hours per week. Since, the histogram appears to be fairly symmetric, there are no significant skewness or outliers in the data.\n\n\nNow, let’s look at a few scatter plots to explore relationships between variables:\n\nggplot(synthetic_data, aes(x = Income, y = JobSatisfaction)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot of Job Satisfaction vs Income\", x = \"Income ($)\", y = \"Job Satisfaction\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations: The scatter plot shows a positive linear relationship between job satisfaction and income. As income increases, job satisfaction tends to increase as well, which is also indicated by the upward sloping trend line.\n\nggplot(synthetic_data, aes(x = HoursWorkedPerWeek, y = JobSatisfaction)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"green\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot of Job Satisfaction vs Hours Worked Per Week\", x = \"Hours Worked Per Week\", y = \"Job Satisfaction\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations: The scatter plot shows a negative linear relationship between job satisfaction and hours worked per hour. As the number of hours worked per hour increases, job satisfaction tends to slightly decrease, which is also indicated by the downward sloping trend line.\n\nggplot(synthetic_data, aes(x = EducationYears, y = PhysicalActivityLevel)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot of Physical Activity Level vs Education Years\", x = \"Years of Education\", y = \"Physical Activity Level\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations: The scatter plot shows a positive linear relationship between physical activity level and years of education. As the number of education years increases, the physical activity tends to increase as well, which is also indicated by the upward sloping trend line.\n\nggplot(synthetic_data, aes(x = HoursWorkedPerWeek, y = PhysicalActivityLevel)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"purple\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot of Physical Activity Level vs Hours Worked Per Week\", x = \"Hours Worked Per Week\", y = \"Physical Activity Level\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations: The scatter plot shows a negative linear relationship between physical activity level and hours worked per hour. As the number of hours worked per hour increases, physical activity tends to slightly decrease, which is also indicated by the downward sloping trend line.\nFinally, let’s look at a visual summary of the relationships between the variables:\n\n# Correlation matrix\ncorrelation_matrix &lt;- synthetic_data %&gt;%\n  select(EducationYears, Income, HoursWorkedPerWeek, JobSatisfaction, PhysicalActivityLevel) %&gt;%\n  cor()\n\nprint(correlation_matrix)\n\n                      EducationYears       Income HoursWorkedPerWeek\nEducationYears           1.000000000  0.004948434         0.01659530\nIncome                   0.004948434  1.000000000         0.03151133\nHoursWorkedPerWeek       0.016595298  0.031511329         1.00000000\nJobSatisfaction          0.015953540  0.832537795        -0.04423735\nPhysicalActivityLevel    0.207776282 -0.047461368        -0.19617808\n                      JobSatisfaction PhysicalActivityLevel\nEducationYears             0.01595354            0.20777628\nIncome                     0.83253779           -0.04746137\nHoursWorkedPerWeek        -0.04423735           -0.19617808\nJobSatisfaction            1.00000000           -0.02666298\nPhysicalActivityLevel     -0.02666298            1.00000000\n\n\n\n# Visualize the correlation matrix\ncorrplot(correlation_matrix, method = \"circle\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to interpret the correlation matrix:\n\nDarker and larger circles indicate stronger correlations while light and smaller circles indicate weaker correlations.\nThe correlation range from -1 to 1 where 1 indicated positive correlation and -1 indicates a negative correlation.\n\nBased on the above methods of interpretation following are the observations:\n\nThere is moderate positive correlation between education years and income. Higher education levels tends to associate with higher income.\nThere is moderate positive correlation between income and job satisfaction. Higher incomes tends to associate with higher job satisfaction.\nThere is a slight negative correlation between hours worked per week and job satisfaction. As the number of hours worked increases, job satisfaction tends to decrease slightly.\nThere is a slight positive correlation between education years and physical activity level. More years of education are associated with higher physical activity levels.\nThere is a slight negative correlation between hours worked per week and physical activity level. More hours worked per week are associated with lower physical activity levels."

I have worked with Python, R and SQL in my bachelor’s and previous classes taken for this course. One of the recent data analysis I was part of had to do with analyzing how laptop prices are influenced by various features such as storage capacity, pixels, battery life etc.\n\n\nResearch interest:\nMainly I am interested in learning how to create dynamic and interactive dashboards that allow users to explore data visually. As I learn more about data analysis through this course I am interested in developing models to quantify and prioritize cyber security risk based on data-driven analysis.\n\n\nInteresting thing about me:\nI have over 10 years of training in Karnatic music.\n\n\nAn interesting website to checkout:\nOurWorldinChart provides research and data visualizations about the world’s largest problems.

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/rinuthomas/Documents/PracticumII/rinuthomas_P2_portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful. So let’s fix that first.\n\nd1 &lt;- rawdata %&gt;% dplyr::filter( Height != \"sixty\" ) %&gt;% \n                  dplyr::mutate(Height = as.numeric(Height))\nskimr::skim(d1)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nd1\n\n\nNumber of rows\n13\n\n\nNumber of columns\n5\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n2\n\n\nnumeric\n3\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nGender\n0\n1\n1\n2\n0\n5\n0\n\n\nEyeColor\n0\n1\n4\n5\n0\n3\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nHeight\n0\n1.00\n151.62\n46.46\n6\n154.00\n165\n175\n192\n▁▁▁▂▇\n\n\nWeight\n1\n0.92\n647.92\n2000.48\n45\n54.75\n73\n90\n7000\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nWaistSize\n1\n0.92\n31.67\n3.50\n25\n29.75\n32\n34\n38\n▂▇▃▇▂\n\n\n\n\nhist(d1$Height)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we see that there is one person with a height of 6.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

title: "Presentation Exercise"

# **INTRODUCTION**

For this exercise, I am using a chart and dataset that I found while exploring Gapminder. The chart and dataset shows how the number of babies per women has dropped across the world over the years. The chart and dataset that I will be using can be found at this [link](https://www.gapminder.org/topics/babies-per-woman/).

# **RECREATING CHART**

## **SCREENSHOT OF THE CHART BEING RECREATED:**

## **STEPS TAKEN TO RECREATE THE CHART USING CHATGPT:**

For the purpose of the exercise I used CHATGPT.

I first provided CHATGPT with the dataset and the screenshot of the chart. Then asked the following question:

*“Using the dataset can you recreate the graph in the screenshot using R code?*

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(readr)

# Define data location using here() package
data_location = here::here("presentation-exercise","babies_per_women.csv")

# Load Data
data = read_csv(data_location)
str(data)


# Create the plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = time, y = Babies_per_woman)) +
  geom_line(size = 2) +
  geom_point(data = filter(data, time == 1800), size = 5) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1800, y = 5.8, label = "1800"), vjust = -1) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1965, y = 5, label = "1965\n5 births"), vjust = -1) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 2017, y = 2.5, label = "2017\n2.5 births"), vjust = -1) +
  annotate("segment", x = 2017, xend = 2060, y = 2.5, yend = 2.0, linetype = "dashed", arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"))) +
  labs(title = "AVERAGE NUMBER OF BABIES PER WOMAN FROM 1800 TO TODAY",
       x = "", y = "") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

# Save the plot
ggsave("average_number_of_babies_per_woman.png", width = 10, height = 6)

```

The initial code provided by CHATGPT required a few fixes to make the chart look same as the original chart. The fixes included:

-   Fixing the tail end to have dotted line.

-   Adding a circle at the point where it says “1965 5 Births”.

-   Adjusting the size of the chart to make it more visible.

## **PROMPTS TO FIX:**

I used multiple prompts to fix and produce the final chart.

The prompts included:

*“Can you remove the solid line at the tail end and make it a dashed line to make it look similar to the screenshot provided?”*

*“Add a circle at point where it says”1965 5 births”*

*“Can you adjust the size of the chart to make more the contents more visible?”*

Finally, to fix few a alignment issues I made some changes to the final code.

## **FINAL CODE FROM CHATGPT AND FINAL CHART**

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(readr)

# Define data location using here() package
data_location = here::here("presentation-exercise","babies_per_women.csv")

# Load Data
data = read_csv(data_location)
str(data)

# Separate the actual and projected data
actual_data <- filter(data, time <= 2017)
projection <- data.frame(time = c(2017, 2100), `Babies_per_woman` = c(2.5, 2.0))

# Create the plot
ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(data = actual_data, aes(x = time, y = `Babies_per_woman`), method = "loess", span = 0.2, size = 2, color = "black", se = FALSE) +
  geom_line(data = projection, aes(x = time, y = `Babies_per_woman`), linetype = "dashed", size = 1, color = "black") +
  geom_point(data = filter(data, time == 1800), aes(x = time, y = `Babies_per_woman`), size = 6, color = "black") +
  geom_text(data = filter(data, time == 1800), aes(x = time, y = `Babies_per_woman`, label = "1800"), vjust = -1.5, size = 4, fontface = "bold") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1965, y = 5, label = "1965\n5 births"), vjust = -1.25, size = 4, fontface = "bold") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 2017, y = 2.5, label = "2017\n2.5 births"), vjust = -1, size = 4, fontface = "bold") +
  annotate("segment", x = 2017, xend = 2100, y = 2.5, yend = 2.0, linetype = "dashed", size = 1, color = "black", arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm"))) +
  annotate("point", x = 1965, y = 5, color = "black", size = 10, shape = 21, fill = NA) +
  annotate("segment", x = max(actual_data$time), xend = max(actual_data$time) + 1, y = tail(actual_data$`Babies_per_woman`, 1), yend = tail(actual_data$`Babies per woman`, 1), color = "black", size = 2, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"))) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(2, 6), breaks = seq(2, 6, by = 1)) +
  labs(title = "AVERAGE NUMBER OF BABIES PER WOMAN FROM 1800 TO TODAY",
       x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "grey90"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

# Save the plot with reduced size
ggsave("average_number_of_babies_per_woman_final.png", width = 8, height = 5)
```

# **CREATING PUBLICATION QUALITY TABLE**

I provided CHATGPT with the following prompts to create the table:

*“Utilizing the dataset provided create a professional looking table using R code”*

*“Only include columns Year and Babies per women”*

*“Make the table to display averages of every 10 years”*

## **FINAL CODE FROM CHATGPT AND FINAL TABLE**

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Define data location using here() package
data_location = here::here("presentation-exercise","babies_per_women.csv")

# Load Data
data = read_csv(data_location)
str(data)

# Group by decade and calculate the average number of babies per woman
data_decade <- data %>%
  mutate(Decade = (time %/% 10) * 10) %>%
  group_by(Decade) %>%
  summarise(`Average Babies per Woman` = mean(`Babies_per_woman`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Create a professional-looking table with a centered, bold heading
data_decade %>%
  kable("html", col.names = c("Decade", "Average Babies per Woman"), align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive", "bordered"), full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "dodgerblue") %>%
  column_spec(2, bold = T) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, background = "darkblue", color = "white") %>%
  add_header_above(c("Average Number of Babies per Woman by Decade" = 2), bold = TRUE, align = "c", color = "black", background = "lightgray")

```

# Summary/Abstract

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to estimate medical insurance costs for individuals based on their health-related and personal attributes. This model will help in understanding the key factors influencing insurance charges and assist insurance companies in pricing policies more accurately.

# Introduction

## General Background Information

Medical insurance costs are a significant financial consideration for individuals and families. These costs can vary widely based on numerous factors such as age, lifestyle, health conditions, and geographical location. Predicting these costs accurately is crucial for both individuals seeking to manage their healthcare expenses and insurance companies aiming to price their policies effectively.

#### Importance of Predictive Modeling in Insurance

Predictive modeling plays a vital role in the insurance industry. Accurate predictions of insurance costs enable companies to:

-   Assess risk more effectively.

-   Set premiums that reflect the actual risk associated with individual policyholders.

-   Enhance customer satisfaction by offering personalized and fair pricing.

On the consumer side, individuals can benefit from understanding the factors that influence their insurance costs, allowing them to make informed choices about their health and financial planning.

## Description of data and data source

*Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section.*

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. The dataset comprises 2.7K rows and 7 columns and contains the following features:

-   **Age**: Age of the individual.

-   **Sex**: Gender of the individual (male/female).

-   **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight.

-   **Children**: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.

-   **Smoker**: Smoking status of the individual (yes/no).

-   **Region**: Geographical region in the US where the individual resides (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).

-   **Charges**: Medical insurance costs billed by the insurance company (target variable).

### 

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

*State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis.*

The primary question we aim to answer using the "Medical Insurance Cost Prediction" dataset is:

**"What are the key factors influencing medical insurance costs, and how accurately can we predict these costs based on individuals' demographic and health-related attributes?"**

### Outcomes of Interest

The main outcome of interest in this analysis is:

-   **Medical Insurance Costs (charges)**: The amount billed by the insurance company for an individual's medical insurance.

### Specific Predictors

The specific predictors (independent variables) we will focus on include:

-   **Age**: How age influences insurance costs.

-   **Sex**: The impact of gender on insurance costs.

-   **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: The relationship between BMI and insurance costs.

-   **Children**: How the number of dependents affects insurance costs.

-   **Smoker**: The effect of smoking status on insurance costs.

-   **Region**: Regional differences in insurance costs within the US.

### Relations/Patterns of Interest

I am looking for several key relationships and patterns in the data, including:

1.  **Age and Insurance Costs**:

    -   Investigating whether older individuals tend to have higher medical insurance costs.

2.  **Gender Differences**:

    -   Analyzing whether there is a significant difference in insurance costs between males and females.

3.  **BMI and Insurance Costs**:

    -   Exploring the relationship between an individual's BMI and their medical insurance costs.

    -   Identifying any nonlinear patterns where very high or very low BMI values might correlate with higher insurance costs.

4.  **Impact of Smoking**:

    -   Assessing how smoking status (yes/no) affects insurance costs.

    -   Quantifying the cost difference between smokers and non-smokers.

5.  **Number of Children**:

    -   Examining whether having more dependents (children) increases insurance costs.

6.  **Regional Variations**:

    -   Identifying differences in insurance costs across different regions in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).

To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here `dataanalysis_template_references.bib`) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a]

# Methods

*Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement.*

#### Data description:

The dataset includes information about individuals and their corresponding medical insurance costs. The dataset consist of key features such as age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region and charges.

#### Data cleaning and preprocessing:

The data cleaning and preprocessing steps include:

1.  Loading the data
2.  Converting categorical variables
3.  Checking for missing values
4.  Detecting outliers

#### Analysis Approaches:

1.  Explanatory Data Analysis: Create visualizations, examine and compare features.
2.  Model Building: Build perdictive models using linear regression to estimate *charges* based on other features.

## Data aquisition

*As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next.*

## Data import and cleaning

*Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along.*

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. The dataset was dowloaded directly from Kaggle website. It can be accessed at the following URL: [Medical Insurance Cost Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulvyasm/medical-insurance-cost-prediction).

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Load the dataset
insurance = read.csv("/Users/rinuthomas/Documents/PracticumII/rinuthomas_P2_portfolio/starter-analysis-exercise/products/report/medical_insurance.csv", header = TRUE)

# Convert categorical variables to factors
insurance$sex <- as.factor(insurance$sex)
insurance$smoker <- as.factor(insurance$smoker)
insurance$region <- as.factor(insurance$region)

# View the structure of the dataset
str(insurance)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(insurance,10)

# Check for missing values
sapply(insurance, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# Visualize outliers
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = "", y = bmi)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = "BMI Outliers")
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = "", y = charges)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = "Charges Outliers")

```

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

*Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project.*

@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

```{r echo=FALSE}

# Summary statistics of the dataset
summary(insurance)
```

@tbl-summarytable1 shows a summary of the numerical features.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Summary statistics of numerical features
summary(select(insurance, age, bmi, children, charges))
```

@tbl-summarytable2 shows a summary of the categorical features.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Summary of categorical features
summary(select(insurance, sex, smoker, region))
```

@tbl-summarytable3 shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. **I recommend the `here` package, but I'm showing the other approach here just in case you encounter it.**

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables-files/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

## Basic statistical analysis

*To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p\<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid.*

@fig-charges shows histogram of insurance charges

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="bar") +
  labs(title="Average Insurance Charges by Number of Children", x="Number of Children", y="Average Charges") +
  theme_minimal()
```

@fig-result shows a scatter plot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```

## Full analysis

*Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here.*

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

*Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means.*

## Strengths and Limitations

*Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis.*

## Conclusions

*What are the main take-home messages?*

*Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end*

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses.

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template.

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.

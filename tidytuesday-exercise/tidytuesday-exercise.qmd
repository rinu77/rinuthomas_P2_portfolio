# Introduction

In this analysis, I will load, clean, and explore the dataset provided in \`ratings.csv\`. I will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data, formulate a hypothesis, and fit several machine learning models.

## Load Libraries and Data

```{r}
# Load necessary packages

library (here)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# Load the data
# Define data location using here() package
data_location = here::here("tidytuesday-exercise","data","ratings.csv")

# Load Data
data = read_csv(data_location)
head(data)
str(data)
```

## Data Wrangling

```{r}
# Convert 'airdate' to Date type
data <- data %>%
  mutate(airdate = as.Date(airdate, format = "%B %d, %Y"))

# Convert columns to appropriate data types
data <- data %>%
  mutate(across(c(season, show_number), as.integer))

# Convert '18_49_rating_share' to numeric
data <- data %>%
  mutate(rating_18_49 = as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.]", "", `18_49_rating_share`)))

```

```{r}
# Check for missing values
summary(data)
```

```{r}
# Remove rows with missing values in relevant columns
data <- data %>%
  drop_na(viewers_in_millions, rating_18_49)

```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Summary Statistics

```{r}
# Summary statistics
summary(data)
```

### Distribution of Viewers

```{r}
# Plot the distribution of viewers
ggplot(data, aes(x = viewers_in_millions)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Viewers (in millions)",
       x = "Viewers (in millions)",
       y = "Frequency")
```

**Observation:** This distribution suggests that the TV show has episodes that are either moderately popular (around 10 million viewers) or very popular (around 20-25 million viewers). The right-skew indicates that extremely high viewership episodes are less common but still present.

### Viewers Over Time

```{r}
# Plot viewers over time
ggplot(data, aes(x = airdate, y = viewers_in_millions)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Viewers Over Time",
       x = "Air Date",
       y = "Viewers (in millions)")

```

**Observation:** The "Viewers Over Time" graph highlights significant trends and shifts in audience engagement with the TV show. While the initial years saw high viewership, there has been a consistent decline over the years, indicating changing audience behaviors and market dynamics.

### Ratings vs Viewers

```{r}
# Plot ratings vs viewers
ggplot(data, aes(x = rating_18_49, y = viewers_in_millions)) +
  geom_point(color = "green") +
  labs(title = "Ratings vs Viewers",
       x = "18-49 Rating Share",
       y = "Viewers (in millions)")

```

**Observation:** The scatter plot clearly demonstrates a significant positive relationship between '18-49 Rating Share' and the number of viewers.

## Hypothesis Testing

We hypothesize that episodes with higher '18-49 Rating Share' will have significantly higher 'Viewers in Millions'.

### Linear Regression Analysis

```{r}
# Perform linear regression
model <- lm(viewers_in_millions ~ rating_18_49, data = data)

```

```{r}
# Summary of the model
summary(model)

```

```{r}

# Coefficients of the model
coefficients(model)

# Confidence intervals
confint(model)

# Plot the regression line
ggplot(data, aes(x = rating_18_49, y = viewers_in_millions)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Linear Regression: Viewers vs Rating",
       x = "18-49 Rating Share",
       y = "Viewers (in millions)")

```

**Obsservation:** The hypothesis testing plot shows a strong linear relationship between '18-49 Rating Share' and 'Viewers in Millions', supporting the use of a linear model.

## Split Data into Training and Testing Sets

```{r}
set.seed(123)
data_split <- initial_split(data, prop = 0.8)
train_data <- training(data_split)
test_data <- testing(data_split)

```

## Model Training with Cross-Validation

```{r}
# Set up cross-validation
set.seed(123)
cv_folds <- vfold_cv(train_data, v = 5)

# Define recipe
data_recipe <- recipe(viewers_in_millions ~ rating_18_49, data = train_data)

# Model specifications
lm_spec <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm")

rf_spec <- rand_forest(mtry = 1, trees = 500) %>%
  set_engine("ranger") %>%
  set_mode("regression")

xgb_spec <- boost_tree(trees = 1000, tree_depth = 6, min_n = 10, loss_reduction = 0.01, 
                       sample_size = 0.8, mtry = 1) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("regression")

# Create workflows
lm_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(data_recipe) %>%
  add_model(lm_spec)

rf_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(data_recipe) %>%
  add_model(rf_spec)

xgb_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(data_recipe) %>%
  add_model(xgb_spec)

# Fit models with cross-validation and save predictions
control <- control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)

lm_res <- lm_workflow %>%
  fit_resamples(resamples = cv_folds, 
                metrics = metric_set(rmse, rsq), 
                control = control)

rf_res <- rf_workflow %>%
  fit_resamples(resamples = cv_folds, 
                metrics = metric_set(rmse, rsq), 
                control = control)

xgb_res <- xgb_workflow %>%
  fit_resamples(resamples = cv_folds, 
                metrics = metric_set(rmse, rsq), 
                control = control)
```

## Model Evaluation

### Linear Regression Model

```{r}
# Collect metrics
lm_metrics <- collect_metrics(lm_res)
lm_metrics

# Plot residuals
lm_residuals <- collect_predictions(lm_res)
ggplot(lm_residuals, aes(x = .pred, y = viewers_in_millions)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Linear Regression: Predicted vs Actual",
       x = "Predicted Viewers (in millions)",
       y = "Actual Viewers (in millions)")
```

**Observation:** The plot shows a good linear relationship between the predicted and actual values. There is some spread around the regression line, indicating residual variance.

### Random Forest Model

```{r}
# Collect metrics
rf_metrics <- collect_metrics(rf_res)
rf_metrics

# Plot residuals
rf_residuals <- collect_predictions(rf_res)
ggplot(rf_residuals, aes(x = .pred, y = viewers_in_millions)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Random Forest: Predicted vs Actual",
       x = "Predicted Viewers (in millions)",
       y = "Actual Viewers (in millions)")

```

**Observation:** The plot shows a good fit with a tight clustering around the regression line. Handles non-linear relationships well and is robust to outliers.

### XGBoost Model

```{r}
# Collect metrics
xgb_metrics <- collect_metrics(xgb_res)
xgb_metrics

# Plot residuals
xgb_residuals <- collect_predictions(xgb_res)
ggplot(xgb_residuals, aes(x = .pred, y = viewers_in_millions)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "XGBoost: Predicted vs Actual",
       x = "Predicted Viewers (in millions)",
       y = "Actual Viewers (in millions)")

```

**Observation:** The plot shows a good fit with a tight clustering around the regression line. XGBoost is known for its high performance and ability to handle complex relationships.

### Decision:

Considering the hypothesis and the model evaluations, I would choose the **Random Forest Model** as the best overall model. The random forest model provides a good balance between bias and variance, capturing the non-linear relationships that might be present in the data. It is less sensitive to outliers and can handle a variety of data distributions, making it more reliable in different scenarios. The linear regression model, while simple and interpretable, might not capture all the nuances in the data as effectively as the random forest model.

## Final Model Evaluation on Test Data

```{r}
# Split data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)
data_split <- initial_split(data, prop = 0.8)
train_data <- training(data_split)
test_data <- testing(data_split)

# Define recipe
data_recipe <- recipe(viewers_in_millions ~ rating_18_49, data = train_data)

# Define random forest model specification
rf_spec <- rand_forest(mtry = 1, trees = 500) %>%
  set_engine("ranger") %>%
  set_mode("regression")

# Create workflow
rf_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(data_recipe) %>%
  add_model(rf_spec)

# Fit the model on the training data
rf_fit <- rf_workflow %>%
  fit(data = train_data)

# Make predictions on the test data
test_results <- rf_fit %>%
  predict(new_data = test_data) %>%
  bind_cols(test_data)

test_results <- test_results %>%
  mutate(residuals = viewers_in_millions - .pred)

ggplot(test_results, aes(x = .pred, y = viewers_in_millions)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Random Forest: Predicted vs Actual on Test Data",
       x = "Predicted Viewers (in millions)",
       y = "Actual Viewers (in millions)")

# Residual plot
ggplot(test_results, aes(x = .pred, y = residuals)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Random Forest: Residuals on Test Data",
       x = "Predicted Viewers (in millions)",
       y = "Residuals")
```
